# SmartPoop
This is where the description of my problem and website outline will go. I will figure this out eventually and these are the copied instructions. Create a GitHub repository for your project.
Include:
A page describing your problem and motivation.
A page summarizing your technical approach with AlexNet.
Sections for visualizations, results, and takeaways.
Use simple HTML/CSS, Markdown, or Jekyll templates.
Add screenshots and plots from your Colab experiments.
Enable GitHub Pages to host your site.
Submit both the repository URL and live website URL on Canvas.
